# Busted, packaged for Windows Mudlet

The hardest platform for most people to install LuaRocks on for Mudlet is generally Windows, so I'm working to repackage some of the most useful ones specifically for Mudlet.

Busted is a robust testing framework for Lua with a lot more functionality than the luaunit I have previously packaged.
